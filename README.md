# Release Mastermind

**Save yourself time by using our [Universal GitActions Workflow](https://github.com/Videndum/Universal-GitAction-Workflows) template**

This action is designed to use Github Pull Request data to determin release information, alongside generating changelogs, tags, releases and much more!

To benifit from this action the most, we suggest using [Videndum/manage-github-secrets](https://github.com/Videndum/manage-github-secrets) and [Videndum/super-labeler-action](https://github.com/Videndum/super-labeler-action). This will allow for your workflow to be automated entirely. To see all the benifits of using these other systems, please see demo workflow [below](#use-with-managed-secrets-videndummanage-github-secrets) or checkout our workflow template repository [here](https://github.com/Videndum/Universal-GitAction-Workflows)
